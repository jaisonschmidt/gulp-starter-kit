My Gulp Project Starter Kit.

Note: this package is not finished. Why? Because I believe that projects are unique, so you have to customize for your project.

execute:
# npm install
# gulp

Just this, in build folder you always have a project.

Some commands are helpfull:

- gulp img (copy all images)
- gulp template (copy all templates)
- gulp libs (copy all libs)
